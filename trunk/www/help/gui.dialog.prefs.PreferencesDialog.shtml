<h1>Preferences</h1>

<p>The <b>Preferences</b> dialog can be used to modify various settings that
affect the way Flapjack is used and is displayed.</p>

<h3>General</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Interface display language</b><br>
This setting determines what language Flapjack will display its user interface
in. <b>Automatic</b> will attempt to pick the most suitable language based on
your operating system's settings. If this is not correct, or you wish to use
another language, you can also select from <b>English (UK)</b>, <b>English (US)</b>
, or <b>German</b>. Flapjack will need to be restarted after any changes are
made.<p></p>

<li><b>Check for newer Flapjack versions</b><br>
This setting determines how often Flapjack will attempt to connect back to its
download server to see if a newer version is available. The options available
are <b>Never</b>, <b>At application startup</b>, <b>Once a day</b>, <b>Once
a week</b>, and <b>Once a month</b>.<p></p>

<li><b>Compress Flapjack project files to save space</b><br>
Toggles on or off project compression. By default, project files are zip-compressed
which significantly reduces the final file size, however, with very large data
sets this may increase the time taken to save and/or load projects.<p></p>
</ul>


<h3>Visualization</h3>

<ul>
<li><b>Attempt to back-buffer the main canvas to improve performance</b><br>
Selecting this option will cause Flapjack to try and store a buffered copy of
the entire display area (even the parts not currently visible) in any available
free memory. This can significantly improve rendering speeds, especially when
navigating around large data sets on small zoom levels (small allele box sizes).
<p></p>

<li><b>Use an 8-bit colour buffer to reduce memory usage</b><br>
This is only available if the back-buffer option (above) has been ticked.
Selecting this will draw the back-buffer using just 8-bits per pixel instead of
the usual 24. This reduces memory usage for the buffer by a third, meaning it
may be possible for Flapjack to buffer larger areas than normal, but visual
quality will be noticeably reduced.
<p></p>

<li><b>Enable advanced canvas zoom controls</b><br>
Selecting this option will change the standard "zoom" control option for zooming
in and out of the display into separate horizontal and vertical zoom controls.
This gives more control of the display but may reduce the effect of some
visualizations. Use with caution.<p></p>
</ul>

<h3>Warnings</h3>

<p>Flapjack can inform you when certain events take place. Once you are used to
these events, you may wish to stop further reminders. These options allow for
this.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>When duplicate markers are found during data import</b><br>
Every marker (and line) within a data set imported into Flapjack must be unique.
In the case of markers, Flapjack will continue to import the data even after a
duplicate marker has been found, however it will only use the first instance that
it came upon. Selecting this option will cause Flapjack to display the <b>Duplicate
Markers</b> dialog that informs you if duplicates are found.<p></p>

<li><b>When the Find By Name dialog's results are cleared due to view changes</b><br>
Selecting this option ensures that if the <b>Find By Name</b> dialog contains
search results and the view is changed between data sets (or multiple views
within a data set) then you will be informed that the search results are no
longer valid for the new view; hence why Flapjack clears them.<p></p>

<li><b>When switching to 'marker mode'</b><br>
Selecting this option will cause Flapjack to remind you that you are now working
in marker mode (along with brief instructions) if a switch is made to marker
mode.<p></p>

<li><b>When switching to 'line mode'</b><br>
Selecting this option will cause Flapjack to remind you that you are now working
in line mode (along with brief instructions) if a switch is made to line mode.<p></p>
</ul>
