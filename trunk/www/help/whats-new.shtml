<h3>New in 0.09.03.09</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Flapjack now supports the import of supplementary QTL data.</li>
<li>NEW: QTLs data files can have any number of additional (optional) numerical columns (LOD, r2, etc).</li>
<li>NEW: Added support for graphically rendering QTLs across multiple "tracks".</li>
<li>NEW: QTLs can now be colour-coded according to the trait they are associated with.</li>
<li>NEW: Flapjack will automatically lay out QTLs over multiple tracks to avoid overlaps.</li>
<li>NEW: Added support for mouse interactions (info popups) for QTLs and for moving QTLs between tracks.</li>
<li>NEW: QTLs can be clicked on and all markers associated with them with toggle their selection state.</li>
<li>NEW: QTLs can be manually moved between tracks by CTRL clicking and dragging.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a new front-end to the program that provides quick links to recent projects, help, etc.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a QTL summary table with controls to toggle the visibility of individual QTLs.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a Filter QTLs dialog to assist in visibility selection based on trait and experiment.</li>
<li>NEW: Added toolbar shortcut buttons for inverting the selection state of lines and markers.</li>
<li>NEW: Added many new help topics and placeholders for areas still to be included.</li>
<li>NEW: Hovering the mouse over a QTL that is drawn under its neighbours will now render that QTL on top.</li>
<li>CHG: The Traits folder on the project navigation tree now supports QTL and phenotype trait data.</li>
<li>CHG: The similarity colour schemes will now do half-and-half colouring of heterozygotes.</li>
<li>CHG: Colour-boxes (such as in the Customize Colours dialog) now render using gradients.</li>
<li>CHG: All "floating" dialog boxes (such as Find By Name) will now auto-close when navigating to another view or data set.</li>
<li>CHG: Importing an additional set of phenotype traits will now overwrite rather than append the existing set.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a problem with importing genotype data files that contain non zero length lines that held no data.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New in 0.09.02.03</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Flapjack can now read files containing genotype data that does not include heterozygous separator characters, for example "AT" can be read as "A/T" or "A" and "T" (depending on import options).</li>
<li>CHG: Flapjack is now better at estimating what default colour scheme to use when a data set is first imported.</li>
<li>BUG: Importing the sample data set after modifying the import options away from their defaults no longer results in the sample not loading correctly.</li>
<li>BUG: Re-clicking on the same row again in the Find Dialog will now graphically highlight the result again.</li>
<li>BUG: The two-colour scheme now properly colours heterozygotes to match the colours selected for the primary homozygotes.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New in 0.09.01.27</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: The line and marker under the mouse is now graphically highlighted on the main canvas and in the names list.</li>
<li>NEW: Lines names in the list are now graphically highlighted as the mouse moves over the canvas.</li>
<li>NEW: Added an option for right-click deletion of dummy lines that have been inserted.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a proper selection dialog for loading trait data.</li>
<li>CHG: Flapjack now has an enhanced visual scheme that should appear less grey/drab, especially in dialog boxes.</li>
<li>CHG: Highlighted lines and markers (eg from the Find Dialog) now appear in the centre of the display.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a crash that could occur when CTRL+click moving a line from a position outside of the visible list.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed some redraw issues with the traits heat-map when scrolling the display.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed issues with importing data containing blank lines BEFORE the end of the file was reached.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed issues with importing data that mixed the case of genotypes (eg 'a' and 'A').</li>
</ul>

<h3>New in 0.08.09.05</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Added a new option for right-clicking on a line and inserting a "dummy" line at that position.</li>
<li>NEW: Added many more help topics, including a start menu shortcut to the help that is now added at install time.</li>
<li>NEW: Flapjack can now export views back to disk in raw-data format.</li>
<li>NEW: Flapjack license information is now included as part of its install routine.</li>
<li>NEW: Flapjack will detect when a new version has been installed and link the user to a web page describing the major changes.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed errors relating to mixing numerical and categorical data for a single trait.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a bug that caused inverting the selection states of lines to run incorrectly.</li>
</ul>

<h3>New in 0.08.08.08</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: "Bookmarks" can now be assigned to any location within a view, allowing the user to quickly return to regions of interest.</li>
<li>NEW: Flapjack can now be linked with Germinate-like database websites for display of additional line or marker information. When exporting data from Germinate in Flapjack format this information will be included automatically.</li>
<li>NEW: Added displayable sort scores to the list of line names (that appears after performing a similarity sort).</li>
<li>NEW: Added a right-click pop-up menu option to the list of line names to toggle the sort scores on or off.</li>
<li>NEW: The colours used for the traits heatmap can now be customized by the user.</li>
<li>CHG: Flapjack's data modal has been updated to allow it to cope with data sets that use large numbers of unique alleles per locus (eg SSR data).</li>
<li>CHG: The random colour scheme now correctly displays heterozygous alleles as a diagonal split with appropriate colour coding for each half.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a bug in the Find by Name dialog that could cause Flapjack to crash when quickly selecting multiple results.</li>
</ul>
