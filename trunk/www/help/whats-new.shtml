<h3>New in 0.10.04.27</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Implemented multicore/cpu rendering for the main canvas.</li>
<li>NEW: Added an option to sort lines by importing an external file that contains the order to put them in (one "line" per line).</li>
<li>CHG: Removed the ability to back-buffer the entire main canvas.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed some rendering bugs on OS X systems.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New in 0.10.03.10</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Implemented three new methods of scaling and displaying the chromosome map: local, global, and classic.</li>
<li>NEW: Added a new summary "mini map" display that shows where on the chromosome the markers currently on screen are.</li>
<li>NEW: Gaps in the data set (lines with no value for a given marker) can now be graphically highlighted.</li>
<li>NEW: Internet proxy settings can now be configured using the Preferences Dialog.</li>
<li>CHG: Some of the options from the Visualization menu now form part of a new View top-level menu.</li>
<li>CHG: The chromosome map is now drawn in real-time rather than back buffered, freeing up memory.</li>
<li>CHG: Removed the "Flapjack has encountered an error" dialog due to it not working probably with EDT errors.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed various miscellaneous rendering issues.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed some number formatting problems when large numbers were displayed.</li>
<li>BUG: Some of the error messages displayed during file loading were incorrect.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a critical problem with loading data that goes beyond the byte limit for Flapjack's state table (eg with SSR data).</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a problem with the small overview inset window that resulted in it disappearing completely at times.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New in 0.09.10.29</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Importing very large chromosomes (> 20,000 markers) is now significantly quicker.</li>
<li>NEW: You can now choose which chromosomes are including when exporting data as text.</li>
<li>NEW: The number of tracks used for QTLs is now dynamic, based on a draggable slider below their display.</li>
<li>NEW: QTLs are now painted bottom-to-top, keeping them closer to the map than before.</li>
<li>NEW: QTLs that overlap one another on the same track are now outlined in black.</li>
<li>CHG: As QTL layout is now dynamic based on the slider position, support for CTRL/CMD movement of QTL between tracks has been removed.</li>
<li>CHG: QTL changes have meant a slight change to the .flapjack project format, so any existing projects will need any QTL data reimported.</li>
<li>CHG: Simplified the settings dialog for exporting data as text.</li>
<li>BUG: The status labels at the bottom of the screen were not resetting properly after mousing-over QTLs.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New in 0.09.10.02</h3>

<ul>
<li>BUG: Fixed a rendering bug that was causing the chromosome map to incorrectly link its lines to the markers.</li>
</ul>


<h3>New in 0.09.10.01</h3>

<ul>
<li>NEW: Exported images now include any phenotype heat map and/or QTL visualization as part of the output.
<li>NEW: Added keyboard shortcuts for zooming (CTRL++, CTRL+-).
<li>CHG: Made various changes to the installers to improve Linux compatibility and to provide "What's New" information at update time.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a problem with hidden QTLs reappearing if the mouse moved over their position.</li>
<li>BUG: Fixed a problem with some QTLs not responding to mouse over events.</li>
