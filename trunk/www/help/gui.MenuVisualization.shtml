<h3>Colour scheme</h3>
<p>Opens a sub-menu displaying various options for selecting or modifying the
colour scheme in use by the current view.</p>

<h5>Nucleotide model</h5>
<p>Selects the nucleotide model as the current colour scheme for the view.</p>

<h5>Simple 2 colour model</h5>
<p>Selects the simple 2 colour model as the current colour scheme for the view.</p>

<h5>By similarity to line (2 colour)</h5>
<p>Prompts for a comparison line and uses it as the basis for setting the line
similarity scheme as the current colour scheme for the view.</p>

<h5>By allele frequency</h5>
<p>Selects the allele frequency colour model as the current colour scheme for
the view, and displays the <a href="gui.dialog.AlleleFrequencyDialog.shtml">Allele

state, it will only take effect at higher zoom levels (when the size of each
allele's "box" is large).</p>

<h3>Highlight heterozygotes</h3>
<p>Toggles on or off the option to enhance the display of heterozygous alleles,
dimming all other remaining alleles so that they are less visible.</p>

<h3>Highlight gaps</h3>
<p>Toggles on or off the option to enhance the display of missing data,
dimming all other remaining alleles so that they are less visible.</p>

dialog that allows you to pick which traits should be displayed on the traits
heatmap alongside the list of line names.</p>

<h3>Create new view</h3>
