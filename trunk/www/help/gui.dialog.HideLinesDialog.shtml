<h2>Show/Hide Lines</h2>

<p>You can use the <b>Show/Hide Lines</b> dialog to control which lines
are visible within the current view. Options are provided that allow you to hide
existing lines, or to restore previously hidden lines so that they become
visible again.</p>

<h3>Hiding lines</h3>

<p>Flapjack offers three methods of hiding lines, two of which are available
via this dialog:

<ul>
<li><b>Hide all the lines that are NOT currently selected</b><br>
Selecting this method will hide lines that are not part of the currently
selected set (these lines will be shown faded on the main display).</li>
<li><b>Hide all the lines that ARE currently selected</b><br>
Selecting this method will hide lines that are part of the currently
selected set.</li>
</ul>

<p>To visually see which lines are selected or not, ensure Flapjack is in
Line Mode before opening the <b>Show/Hide Lines</b> dialog.</p>

<p>The third method of hiding markers is available for quickly hiding a single
line only. CTRL (or CMD on OS X) double-click a line
on the canvas while in Line Mode, and it will be removed from the visible
set.</p>


<h3>Restoring lines</h3>

<p>Lines that have been previously hidden can be restored to the view by
clicking the <b>Restore hidden lines</b> button (which will only be enabled
if there are actually lines available to be restored).</p>

<p>Note that all restored lines will be readded to the view <i>at the end</i> of the
current set of lines.</p>
