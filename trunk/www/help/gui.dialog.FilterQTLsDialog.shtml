<h2>Filter QTLs</h2>

<p>The <b>Filter QTLs</b> dialog is used to enable or disable the display of QTLs
on the map based on a combination of the values assigned to each QTL for its
associated trait <b>and</b> experiment.</p>

<p>The dialog presents two tables; one showing a list of every trait within the
current QTL data set, and another showing a list of every experiment. The QTLs
can be filtered by selecting a combination of trait and experiment, so that only
QTLs that match the values of both tables will be left visible.</p>

<p>To apply the current filter, click the <b>Apply filter</b> button. The effect
takes place immeditately and you can check the result in Flapjack without closing
the <b>Filter QTLs</b> dialog.</p>

<p>Note also, that the checked values within the tables may change dynamically
when the filter runs. For example, say you had selected to show only QTLs that
were assocaited with the trait <i>height</i> across experiments <i>x1</i> and <i>x2</i>. If
<i>x2</i> has no QTLs with that trait then its checkbox will be cleared
automatically when the filter runs.</p>
