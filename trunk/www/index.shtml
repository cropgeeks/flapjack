<h2>Flapjack - Graphical Genotyping</h2>

<p>Visit the <a href="download.shtml">download page</a> to get the latest version of Flapjack (1.12.05.25; 25th May 2012) now.</p>

<p>New software tools for graphical genotyping and haplotype visualization are
required that can routinely handle the large data volumes generated by high
throughput SNP and comparable genotyping technologies. Flapjack is a new
visualization tool to facilitate analysis of these data types. Its
visualizations are rendered in real-time allowing for rapid navigation and
comparisons between lines, markers and chromosomes.</p>

<p>Based on the input of map, genotype and trait data Flapjack is able to
provide a number of alternative graphical genotype views with individual alleles
coloured by state, frequency or similarity to a given standard line. Flapjack
supports a range of interactions with the data, including graphically moving
lines or markers around the display, insertions or deletions of data, and
sorting or clustering of lines by either genotype similarity to other lines, or
by trait scores. Any map based information such as QTL positions can be aligned
against graphical genotypes to identify associated haplotypes.</p>

<p>All results are saved in an XML-based project format and can also be exported
as raw data or graphically as image files. We have devised efficient data
storage structures that provide high-speed access to any subset of the data,
resulting in fast visualization regardless of the size of the data.</p>
