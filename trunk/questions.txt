Data formatting:
 - what to do if a marker (with the same name) exists at more than one place on
   the same chromosome map
 - what to do if a marker (with the same name) exists on more than one map
 - what to do if a line with the same name is found more than once


Is A/T the same as T/A? If so, can we include both in the lookup table (fast)
or include code to combine them (slow, but could reduce lookup entry numbers)

Is 127/255 lookup table entries enough (all that we can store in a single byte).
Going to two bytes 2^16 (65535) will use double the memory.
