Customize Colours
=================

The ``Customize Colours`` dialog (``Visualizaton->Colour scheme->Customize``) is used to modify (or reset) the colours used by Flapjack for various components of its visualization. The dialog can also be used to select the current colour scheme in use.

 |ColorDialog|

The colours within Flapjack that can be modified are listed in the ``Standard colours`` list within the dialog. These are the colours that are used regardless of the scheme selected. Scheme-specific colours are shown in the ``Scheme specific`` list. Changing to another colour scheme will change the list of modifiable colours.

To change a colour, simply double click it with the mouse, and choose a new colour from the dialog that appears. To reset all colours (across all schemes), press the ``Reset colours`` button.
