Quick Export Data
=================

The ``Quick Export All Data`` dialog (``File->Quick export``) can be used to save the raw data forming the current project to a set of files on disk. The dialog prompts for a location to save to, before writing the following output files:

* Map data
* Genotype data
* Phenotype data
* QTL data

Each dataset and/or custom view within the project will have its own set of output files created. All of the files will be in standard Flapjack input format, as defined in the :doc:`projects_&_data_formats` topic.
