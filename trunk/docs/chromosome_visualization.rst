Chromosome Visualization
========================

The ``Chromosomes Visualization`` tab can be switched to by selecting its option on the toolbar, or by using the ``View->Chromosomes view`` menubar option.

Chromosome visualization presents an overview diagram of all chromosomes in the current dataset, and the location and density of their markers. Each chromosome can be clicked on, which will then render additional information about it using the graph view at the bottom of the window.
