<h2>Sort Lines - Importing an Order</h2>

<p>Flapjack allows you to resort a view's ordering of lines by importing a sort
order from an external file.</p>

<p>The format of the file is extremely simple; each line of the file should
contain the name of a (Flapjack) line, with the ordering being dictated from
top to bottom. For example, a file containing the entries:

<pre>
  Noelle
  Raina
  Paloma
  Daphne
</pre>

Would resort those four lines in a Flapjack view to be in that order, with
Noelle first and Daphne last.</p>

<p>Note that any lines that exist in the view but are not found in the
external file will remain in the view, but will be moved to the end/bottom of
the new order.</p>
