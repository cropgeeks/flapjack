<h2>Graph Visualization</h2>

<p>Flapjack allows you to import "graphs" - which are files that contain one or more
values per marker which can be visualized alongside the main display. Flapjack
supports two style of graph - histogram and line graph.</p>

<h3>Importing graph data</h3>

<p>Import a graph file using the <a href="gui.dialog.DataImportDialog.shtml">Import Data</a> dialog.
Note that any graph data that is imported will overwrite any existing graph data held in the current
data set, but the file format supports more than one graph anyway.</p>

<p>The structure of a graph file is tab-delimited text. Each line provides details on a marker via three columns in the following format:</p>

<pre>
  MarkerName      GraphName     Value
</pre>

<p>For example:</p>

<pre>
  11_20479        Height          10.5
  11_20480        Height           9.4
  11_20479        Resistance     0.234
  11_20480        Resistance     0.993
  ...
</pre>

<p>Each graph can also have an optional significance threshold value associated with it. This
is specified by using the reserved "SIGNIFICANCE_THRESHOLD" keyword in the file, for example:</p>

<pre>
  SIGNIFICANCE_THRESHOLD    Height     8.0
  11_20479                  Height    10.5
  ...
</pre>


<h3>Interacting with a graph</h3>

<p>You can select which graph to display, along with the type of graph (line or histogram) by using
the <b>Select Graph</b> dialog.</p>

<p>When you mouse over a graph, the status panel will show you:
<ul>
  <li>the name of the marker currently under the mouse
  <li>the name of the graph
  <li>the value of the marker (and optionally the graph's threshold value in parenthesis)
</ul>
</p>

<p>When displaying a histogram, the intensity of the colour is used to represent the value;
the stronger the colour, the higher the value.</p>

<p>If a graph has a significance threshold, then this will be displayed on the graph as a dotted line.</p>
