<h2>Allele Frequency Threshold</h2>

<p>After selecting the <b>by allele frequency</b> colour scheme, the <b>Allele
Frequency Threshold</b> dialog appears, allowing you to choose the cut-off
threshold between low and high frequency alleles.</p>

<p>A low frequency allele (blue by default) will be any allele within a given marker that occurs
at a percentage less than the chosen threshold. A high frequency allele (green by default) will be any allele within a given marker that occurs
at a percentage greater than the chosen threshold.</p>

<p>The underlying method for this scheme calculates a percentage frequency for every allele found across a
marker, ignoring unknown genotypes. For example, if you had five lines with the
genotypes A/A, A/T, A/A, A/T and A/A at a given locus, then the score for A is 8/10 (80%) and the
score for T is 2/10 (20%).</p>
