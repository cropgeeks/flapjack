<h1>Export Image</h1>

<p>The <b>Export Image</b> dialog can be used to save a PNG format file containing
an image of the current chromosome's view.</p>

<p><a href="images/gui.dialog.ExportImageDialog.png">
<img src="images/gui.dialog.ExportImageDialog2.png"></a></p>

<p>The actual image saved can be one of three possible types:</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Export only what can currently be seen</b><br>
This option will create a high-quality image showing exactly what you currently
see. The current chromosome as shown in Flapjack's main window will be replicated
exactly to the saved image. Line and map information is <i>not</i> included in
this type of export. <a href="images/exportView.png">See example</a>.<p></p>

<li><b>Export all of the current view</b><br>
This option will create a high-quality image showing everything that Flapjack is
currently rendering. All of the data within the chromosome, whether visible on screen
or not will be replicated exactly to the saved image, along with line and map
information. <a href="images/exportAll.png">See example</a>.<p></p>

<li><b>Export a scaled-to-fit image of all of the data</b><br>
This option will create an overview image using the dimensions specified, resulting
in an image that will show all of the data but scaled to fit the given image
dimensions. The quality of the image will depend on this scaling, but you can
expect something similar to what is normally shown in a Flapjack overview window.
Line and map information is <i>not</i> included in this type of export.
<a href="images/exportOverview.png">See example</a>.<p></p>

</ul>

<p>All options are reliant on there being enough free memory for Flapjack to be
able to create (and compress to PNG format) the final image. The dialog gives
an indication of how much memory will be required but no guarantee can be given
that the final image will actually get created.</p>
