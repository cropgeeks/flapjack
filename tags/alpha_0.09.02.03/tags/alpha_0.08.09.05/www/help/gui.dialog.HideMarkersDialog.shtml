<h1>Show/Hide Markers</h1>

<p>You can use the <b>Show/Hide Markers</b> dialog to control which markers
are visible within the current view. Options are provided that allow you to hide
existing markers, or to restore previously hidden markers so that they become
visible again.</p>

<h3>Hiding markers</h3>

<p>Flapjack offers three methods of hiding markers, two of which are available
via this dialog:

<ul>
<li><b>Hide all the markers that are NOT currently selected</b><br>
Selecting this method will hide markers that are not part of the currently
selected set (these markers will be shown faded on the main display).<p></p>
<li><b>Hide all the markers that ARE currently selected</b><br>
Selecting this method will hide markers that are part of the currently
selected set.<p></p>
</ul>

<p>To visually see which markers are selected or not, ensure Flapjack is in
Marker Mode before opening the <b>Show/Hide Markers</b> dialog.</p>

<p>The third method of hiding markers is available for quickly hiding a single
marker only. CTRL (or CMD on OS X) double-click a marker
on the canvas while in Marker Mode, and it will be removed from the visible
set.</p>


<h3>Restoring markers</h3>

<p>Markers that have been previously hidden can be restored to the view by
clicking the <b>Restore hidden markers</b> button (which will only be enabled
if there are actually markers available to be restored).</p>

<p>Note that when restoring markers, Flapjack will search for the best location
to restore each marker to the view, but there will be cases when a marker will
not return to the same location it had originally. This can happen for several
reasons:

<ul>
<li>If the marker shares the exact same chromosome position with one or more
other markers. For example, consider the markers A, B, and C, all located at the
same position on the chromosome. Marker B is set to hidden, then restored. The
marker order after restoration could be ABC, BAC, or ACB - each is equally valid.<p></p>
<li>If other (still visible) markers have been moved around the view. Flapjack
uses the chromosome position to determine where to reinsert a marker, but if
the marker order has been changed, these positions become unusable.<p></p>
</ul>
