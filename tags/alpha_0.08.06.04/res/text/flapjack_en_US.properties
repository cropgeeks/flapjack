gui.dialog.ColorDialog.defaultsMsg=This will reset all colors across all color scheme models to their original values (as shipped with Flapjack).
gui.visualization.colors.NucleotideColorScheme=The nucleotide color scheme provides color information on the assumption that the data contains alleles that are of the form A, C, G, or T. Each base is assigned its own color, and these colors apply to both homozygous and (diploid) heterozygous alleles. Heterozygous alleles are also given a special separate color when rendering in any of the overviews to help distinguish them. All other alleles found within the data are rendered using the Other color.
gui.visualization.colors.SimpleTwoColorScheme=This is a simple two-state color model that can be used when the data are of the form A/B (or +/-, 0/1, etc). The first two homozygous allele states that are found in the imported data are assigned to the two primary colors states listed below. All other alleles found within the data are rendered using the Other color.
gui.visualization.colors.LineSimilarityColorScheme=Coloring by line similarity will apply a single consistent color to the selected comparison line. All other lines will then be colored according to whether the allele at any given locus matches the allele of the comparison line at that locus. Note that this scheme shares its colors with the marker similarity scheme and any colors set here will affect it too.
gui.visualization.colors.MarkerSimilarityColorScheme=Coloring by marker similarity will apply a single consistent color to the selected comparison marker. All other markers will then be colored according to whether the allele on any given line matches the allele of the comparison marker for that line. Note that this scheme shares its colors with the line similarity scheme and any colors set here will affect it too.
gui.visualization.colors.RandomColorScheme=The random color scheme applies entirely random colors to each allele state found within your data. The colors are randomized using a seed that is regenerated each time this scheme is applied to the data.
gui.StatusBar.help18 = Customize the various color schemes by selecting the 'Customize' option from within the 'Color schemes' sub-menu
