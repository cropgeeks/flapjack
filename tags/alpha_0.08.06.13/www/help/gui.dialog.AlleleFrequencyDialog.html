<h1>Allele Frequency Threshold</h1>

<p>After selecting the <b>by allele frequency</b> colour scheme, the <b>Allele
Frequency Threshold</b> dialog appears, allowing you to choose the cutoff
threshold between low and high frequency alleles.</p>

<p>A low frequency allele will be any allele within a given marker that occurs
at a percentage less than the chosen threshold.</p>

<p>A high frequency allele will be any allele within a given marker that occurs
at a percentage greater than the chosen threshold.</p>
