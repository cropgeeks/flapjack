<h2>Export Data</h2>

<p>The <b>Export Data</b> dialog can be used to save the state of the current
data set (maps, markers, and genotypes) as plain text files. The dialog will
create either a .map file (for map data) or a .dat file (for genotype data).</p>

<p>The first step in outputting data is to decide what type of file to create.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>Tab-delimited map file</b><br>
Selecting this option creates a .map file, that will contain a tab-delimited
list of markers from the dataset. The file contains one marker per line, with
each line containing three columns: the marker
name, the name of the chromosome it is on, and its position (in cM) within that
chromosome.</li>
<li><b>Tab-delimited genotype file</b><br>
Selecting this option creates a .dat genotype file, that will contain a
tab-delimited list of lines from the dataset. A header row references the markers,
then each subsequent row contains the name of a line, followed by all the allele
scores for that line against each marker.</li>
</ul>

<p>The second and third steps allow you to filter the exported data, to include
either all the information within the current data set, or just a subset of it.</p>

<ul>
<li><b>All markers and lines</b><br>
If selected, data on all markers and all lines will be exported.</li>
<li><b>Only markers and lines I have selected</b><br>
Selecting this option ensures that only data on currently selected markers and
lines will be exported. Any unselected markers or lines will be excluded from
the export.</li>
<li><p></p>
<li><b>Only include data from the following selected chromosomes</b><br>
Use the table to select which chromosomes should be included in the final output,
with only those chromosomes that have their <b>Included</b> field ticked being
used. Quickly include or exclude all the chromosomes by using the <b>Select all</b>
and <b>Select none</b> buttons.</li>
</ul>

<p>Mixing and matching these settings allows you to create files that include either
all markers and lines (from either all or just some chromosomes), or just some
markers and lines (again, from either all or just some chromosomes).</p>

<p>The exported files can either be re-imported into Flapjack, or can be opened
and viewed in an external text editor or spreadsheet.</p>
